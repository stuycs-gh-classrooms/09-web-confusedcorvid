<h2>History</h2>
<p>
House Sparrows historically lived in Europe, but during the colonization of America were brought to America in an attempt to control an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_sparrow">outbreak of linden moths in New York City in 1852.</a> However, they rapidly spread out of control, and have spread across the entirety of the United States. They have similarly spread and adapted to many other areas across the world due to being brought by ships. 
</p>

<h2>General Appearance and Anatomy</h2>
<p>
House Sparrows are small and brown, with speckles of chestnut, grey, white and black creating a brownish gestalt. They have smallish, pointed wings suited for flying shorter distances in trees or in bushes. These wings have a good balance of breadth to allow for a lot of lift to allow quick takeoff, pointed wingtips allowing for good maneuvering, and a long, mobile tail to allow for a wide range of steering. Their flight is <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Passer_domesticus/">direct and with no gliding.</a>
Males have a small black throat patch and grey patch on the top of their head, while females lack those distinguishing features and are the 'base' House Sparrow, as fledgling and immature members of the species share the same appearance.
