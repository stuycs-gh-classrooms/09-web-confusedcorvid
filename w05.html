<h2>History</h2>
<p>
House Sparrows historically lived in Europe, but during the colonization of America were brought to America by settlers <br>
who were homesick, where they rapidly spread across the entirety of the US. With globalization, they spread even further across the world.

<h2>General Appearance and Anatomy</h2>

House Sparrows are small and brown, with speckles of chestnut, grey, white and black creating a brownish gestalt.
Males have a small black throat patch and grey patch on the top of their head, while females lack those distinguishing <br>
features and are the 'base' House Sparrow.
