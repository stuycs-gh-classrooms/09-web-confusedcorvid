This is a small collection of pages dedicated to educating any who read it on incredibly unnecessary and complex details on the tiny rugrats that flit around New York City. 
House Sparrows are ubiquitous in everyday New York City life; you might find one chirping in any given tree in the city, or a small huddled crowd surrounding a harried person trying to finish their lunch before their feathered onlookers make a move. I the spring, they can also be found cheeping in the trees as they search for a suitable mate. Regardless of where they are encountered, the sight of a small, cheerful bird can brighten anyone's day.

Despite their adorable nature, they are incredibly adaptable and have made their way into many environments for which they were not originally adapted. Much of their success can be attributed to their ideal environment being coexistence with humans; it is believed to have started to depend on human intervention 10,000 years ago. Thus, they can be found wherever humans have spread, and in large numbers. Those large numbers are the second key to their persistence: despite low rates of survival, they easily maintain large populations even with added pressures such as being hunted by humans and cats.
