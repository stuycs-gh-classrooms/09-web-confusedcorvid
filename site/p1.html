<h1>General Appearance and Anatomy</h1>
<p>
House Sparrows are small, brown birds with mottled plumage and conical beaks. They have smallish, pointed wings suited for flying quickly over shorter distances with limited space, such as in trees or in bushes. The wings are broad enough to provide quick lift but also short to allow for better maneuvering between tight gaps. Along with these compact yet versatile wings, they sport a long, mobile tail that allows for a wide range of steering. Their flight is <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Passer_domesticus/">direct and with no gliding.</a>

Males (non-breeding example seen in image right) are the more colorful of the two sexes. They have more vibrant colors in the form of a small black throat patch and face mask, a grey patch on the top of their head, and chestnut feathers on their back. They have two variants: breeding season variant and non-breeding. In breeding plumage, males have more vibrant chestnut colors and a paler underside, as well as a black beak. 
<br>
This is discarded for a more dull plumage in winter, with the black beak turning a yellowish-gray, the black bib becoming spotty, and the underside of the bird becoming grayer. Juvenile male sparrows will not immediately gain their adult male plumage, but will instead gradually molt into it over the course of their first non breeding season (usually winter). The bib of the sparrow grows with each year, and while its purpose is uncertain, theories such as it being a symbol of reproductive health, seniority, or some other socially related function are commonplace. However, regardless of the size of the bib, female sparrows will still be held higher in their social order, which is a 'pecking order' of sorts that dictates which sparrows get to use baths, first pick at food, etc.

Females (seen in image left) are less vibrant than males, with a plumage of hand and light browns. They are the 'base' appearance of sparrows, as immature individuals also exhibit the same coloration. Their beaks and underbellies are tan, while their backs, tails and wings are more streaky and mixed with darker shades of tan and light brown. This coloration allows them to inconspicuously blend into sandy or grassy environments, as they mostly forage on the ground or in shorter grass for seeds and insects.
