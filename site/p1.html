<h1>General Appearance and Anatomy</h1>
<p>
House Sparrows are small and brown, with speckles of chestnut, grey, white and black creating a brownish overall plumage. They have smallish, pointed wings suited for flying shorter distances in trees or in bushes. These wings have a good balance of breadth to allow for a lot of lift to allow quick takeoff and pointed wingtips allowing for good maneuvering. Along with these compact yet versatile wings, they sport a long, mobile tail that allows for a wide range of steering. Their flight is <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Passer_domesticus/">direct and with no gliding.</a>
Males have a small black throat patch and grey patch on the top of their head, while females lack those distinguishing features and are the 'base' House Sparrow, as fledgling and immature members of the species share the same appearance.
