<li>They are one of three species not protected federally in the U.S.A., along with the European Starling and Rock Pigeon. This means that taking one out of the wild, hunting them, or otherwise attacking them is legal. This is due to them being invasive species. I have met multiple people, online or in person who have owned a tame House Sparrow. The birds are often mischievous and remarkably intelligent, as well as exhibiting every little fear of their human. To the right is a gif of a sparrow demonstrating this behavior from the comfort of a human's hand.</li><br>
<li>They can swim if needs must, though are never observed swimming for any purpose other than to escape water. This is a similarity shared by many other birds, though swimming has not been observed in all species of passerine.</li><br>
<li>House Sparrows will often exhibit bathing behavior in a shallow pile of dust. This behavior is known as 'dust-bathing' and helps remove parasites such as mites.</li><br>
<li>They are able to live in many environments, from snowy New York streets  to the arid Sonoran Desert.</li><br>
<li>They can live up to 13 years in the wild, though the oldest House Sparrow ever to live was a captive bird, who died at 23 years old.</li>
