<h1>History</h1>
<p>
House Sparrows historically lived in Europe, but during the colonization of America were brought to America in an attempt to control an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_sparrow">outbreak of linden moths in New York City in 1852.</a> However, they rapidly spread out of control, and have spread across the entirety of the United States. They have similarly spread and adapted to many other areas across the world due to being brought by ships. In fact, a study has been done which utilized the sounds of their chirrups in radio broadcasts across the world to determine their range.
