<h1>History</h1>
<p>
House Sparrows historically lived in Europe, but during the colonization of America were brought to America in an attempt to control an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_sparrow">outbreak of linden moths in New York City in 1852.</a> However, they rapidly spread out of control, and have spread across the entirety of the United States. They have similarly spread and adapted to many other areas across the world due to being brought by ships. In fact, a study has been done which utilized the sounds of their chirrups in radio broadcasts across the world to determine their range.

An abundance of folklore has grown up with the coexistence of sparrow and human. Europeans would place pots around their house in the hopes that the sparrows would nest there, whereupon the young sparrows could be taken and eaten. They were also associated with promiscuity and lechery, and accordingly used as a form of aphrodisiac by association. Due to their incredibly abundant numbers near human habitats, they have also been used as food for animals and humans alike.
